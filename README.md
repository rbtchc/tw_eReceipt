Parser of Taiwan electronic receipt summary
In Taiwan, when you pay with the easycard (an eletronic wallet for small amount payment),
the ministry of finance will keep the eletronic receipt for each transaction.
And you can ask them to send you the receipt summary each month by mail.
It will be sent w/ email subject: 財政部電子發票整合服務平台 - 消費發票彙整通知 and an attachment of CSV file.

This project is created to host the scripts that I use to parse the CSV file for now.
